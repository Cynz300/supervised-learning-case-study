# Case Study: Non-parametric models

In this case study you should use non-parametric supervised learning models you were exposed to in class (such as kNN, decision trees, random forest, boosting) to create a predictive machine learning model.  It may be interesting to compare non-parametric to parametric (linear/logistic regression) results.
